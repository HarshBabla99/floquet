        'Bare' here is defined loosely. For the first range of amplitudes, the bare
        states are truly the bare states (all zero coefficients). For later ranges, we
        define the bare state as the state obtained from the fit from previous range,
        with amplitude evaluated at the lower edge of amplitudes for the new region.
        This is, in a sense, the most natural choice, since it is most analogous to what
        is done in the first window when the overlap is computed against bare
        eigenstates (that obviously don't have amplitude dependence). Moreover, the fit
        coefficients for the previous window by definition were obtained in a window
        that does not include the one we are currently investigating. Asking for the
        state with amplitude values outside of the fit window should be done at your
        own peril.

        Parameters:
            coefficients: coefficients that specify the bare state that we calculate
                overlaps of Floquet modes against.
