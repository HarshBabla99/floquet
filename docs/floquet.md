# Python API

The **floquet** Python API consists of the **FloquetAnalysis** class function **optimize** which performs optimal control, and various models
that can be optimized including **SESolveModel** and **MESolveModel**. There are additionally various utility functions
and classes that help to define an optimization routine (cost functions, file input output, options, etc.)

## Optimization

::: floquet.floquet
    options:

## Amplitude conversion utilities

::: floquet.amplitude_converters
    options:
        show_source: false

## File utilities
